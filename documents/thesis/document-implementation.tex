In this section we will discuss considerations we made during the implementation of \roerei.
These considerations are not very interesting from an academic standpoint, but moreso from an engineering standpoint.
Also students might be interested.

Started implementing with OCaml.
Best choice for implementing due to easy integration with CoqIDE in later stage.
Problems arose during implementation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Serialization and deserialization takes an unacceptable amount of time. (3 minutes vs 1 second in C++).
\item Not ideal standard library implementation for List etc. (not tail recursive), resulting in stack overflows for large objects.
\item 3rd party libraries using the standard library thus becoming unsuitable without patches.
\end{itemize}

Choose to re-implement everything except Parser + Interpreter in C++.
Quite a bit faster for everything.
Currently KNN CV takes 4.5 minutes
