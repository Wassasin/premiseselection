A corpus can have different characteristics, which might reveal strengths or weaknesses of predictors.
The following corpora are used as test cases:

    Corpus & commit & release date & $|S|$ & $|\defs|$ & $|\thms|$ \\\hline
    \input{data/counts}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Corpora examined in this thesis, along with the relevant version, release date and number of objects, definitions and theorems.}
\end{figure}

All code was compiled using \coq version 8.4pl6.
Newer versions no longer support the XML export plugin, and as such do not support the workflow of \roerei as of yet.

\begin{description}
  \item[\coq stdlib]
    Provided with the \coq distribution.
    Use of the library is optional.
    For example, \ssreflect which is included in \mathcomp does not use the \coq stdlib.
    The library has a relatively similar balance between theorems and definitions compared to other corpora.
    It mainly provides algebraic hierarchies, relations and typical operations.
    No complex theorems are included in this library.

  \item[\formalin]
    (or $CH_2O$) \cite{krebbers2015typed}
    A formalisation of the ISO C11 standard of the C programming language.
    It provides operational, executable, and axiomatic semantics for a significant fragment of C11.
    Contrary to similar work done in \compcert \cite{leroy2009formally} and the $\mathbb{K}$-framework \cite{roÈ™u2010overview}, \formalin provides a proof infrastructure that enables to
    prove properties of the language like type preservation and progress.
    The transformations from C to internal semantics are proved to be sound and complete.
    It aims to precisely model the C11 standard, and not a specific implementation provided by a compiler such as with the other two projects.
  \item[\mathclasses] \cite{spitters2011type} \cite{krebbers2011type} \cite{krebbers2011computer}
    A library of abstract interfaces for mathematical structures in \coq.
    It is heavily based on Coq's Type Classes \cite{sozeau2008first} in order to share notations by overloading and specifying with abstract structures by quantification on contexts.
    It provides interfaces for algebraic hierarchies (groups, rings, field, \ldots),
    relations, orders, categories, functors, universal algebra,
    numbers ($\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, \ldots)
    and operations (shift, power, abs, \ldots).
    With it, \mathclasses provides structure inference, multiple inheritance, convenient algebraic manipulation
    and idiomatic use of notations.
    It contains relatively the least amount of theorems compared to the other corpora.
  \item[\corn]
    The \coq Constructive Repository at Nijmegen is a corpus comprised of various different projects developed (partially) at the Radboud University Nijmegen.
    It depends on \mathclasses for the implementation of high performance exact real number arithmetic.
    A relatively older version of \corn is examined, the same as examined by Kaliszyk \cite{kaliszyk2014machine}.
    This in order to attempt to provide a fair comparison of our experimental results.
    Currently it is (roughly) comprised of:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the algebraic hierarchy. \cite{geuvers2002constructive}
      \item Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. \cite{cruz2002constructive}
      \item Program extraction for real computation. \cite{cruz2006large}
      \item Abstract model of the real numbers. \cite{niqui2008coinductive}
      \item Efficient computation with real numbers and metric spaces. \cite{o2008certified}
      \item Riemann integration. \cite{o2010computer}
      \item Interface with Coq's standard library reals. \cite{kaliszyk2008computing}
      \item The ForMath project, for which the \mathclasses library was developed. \cite{spitters2011type}
        It includes an Ordinary Differential Equations solver. \cite{makarov2013picard}
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\mathcomp]
    An extensive body of mathematics formalized with the \ssreflect language.
    The library has its roots in the formal proof of the Four Colour Theorem.
    Most notably it provided a proof for the Odd Order Theorem \cite{gonthier2013machine}.
    It is the largest of all corpora investigated in this thesis.

\todo{more detailed dependency graph}

When estimating performance using \crossvalidation the dependencies of corpora are fully added to the trainingset.
Only the specific corpus itself is split into separate parts and can form the testset.
