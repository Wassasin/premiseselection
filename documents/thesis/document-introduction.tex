In this master thesis an approach to premise selection for Coq using machine learning is described.
This approach is based upon the work by Kaliszyk et al \cite{kaliszyk2014machine}.
It consists of methods for extracting the relevant data from the Coq system, to learn
machine learning models based on this data, and to evaluate the performance of these methods.
We evaluate the performance of various models on multiple Coq corpora.
The goal of this thesis is to first validate the previous experiments done by Kaliszyk et al,
and then improve upon these experiments with new machine learning methods.
We also hope to gain insight into the characteristics of varying corpora from the results of these experiments.
The validation of the work by Kaliszyk however does not succeed.
The confidence concerning the results of this thesis are therefor in doubt.
Assuming that our implementation is correct, we succesfully implement slightly better machine learning methods.
The insight gained into characteristics of the various corpora however is limited.
