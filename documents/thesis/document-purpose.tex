Theorem proving is the process for which proofs are constructed as formal mathematical objects.
These objects are inductively defined data structures which are constructed using axioms and inference rules.
Whereas a normal proof need may contain errors (as they are sketched with various degrees of confidence),
formal proofs yield complete confidence as to their so-called proof truth.
Formalizing existing proofs, thus establishing the absolute proof truth of their theorems, is a popular field of study within formal mathematics.

In general formal proofs are more verbose and require more work to formulate compared to normal proofs.
With the assistance of computer programs called theorem provers this process has been simplified.
This so-called automated theorem proving is in fact the driving force for the establishment of the computer sciences.

However theorem provers employ various degrees of automation.
Interactive theorem provers (ITP's) or proof assistants often contain a graphical user interface designed to let a human guide the search for proofs.
Even with the help of humans, interactive theorem provers often still automate some aspects of the process.
Notable ITP's include ACL2, Coq, HOL (Light), Isabelle, Mizar and PVS.

Conversely fully automated theorem provers are just called automated theorem provers (ATP's), and need not have a (graphical) user interface.
Fully automated ATP's include Alt-Ergo, E, Prover9 and Vampire.

For this thesis we will be working towards partially developing full automation for the interactive theorem prover \coq.
Currently automation for the \coq is limited to the following tactics:
\begin{description}
\item[assumption]
  \footnote{
    \coq Reference Manual, Chapter 8:
    Tactics\\
    \url{https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual010.html\#hevea_tactic5}
  }
  Searches in the local context for an hypothesis which fits the current goal.
\item[auto]
  \footnote{
    \coq Reference Manual, Chapter 8:
    Tactics\\
    \url{https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual010.html\#hevea_tactic148}
  }
  Implements a Prolog-like resolution procedure to solve the current goal.
  It first applies the \texttt{assumption} tactic, and reduces the goal using \texttt{intros}.
  \texttt{auto} then runs a search for applicable tactics on the goal and subgoals, starting with the lowest cost tactic.
  This tactic can be tweaked on with various parameters and hints, such as the search depth.
\item[trivial]
  \footnote{
    \coq Reference Manual, Chapter 8:
    Tactics\\
    \url{https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual010.html\#hevea_tactic150}
  }
  A restriction of \texttt{auto} that is not recursive and only applies tactics with no cost.
\item[tauto]
  \footnote{
    \coq Reference Manual, Chapter 8:
    Tactics\\
    \url{https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual010.html\#hevea_tactic154}
  }
  A decision procedure for intuitionistic propositional calculus.
  Restricted to unfolding negations and logical equivalence.
  \texttt{tauto} is based on LJT* calculus by Dyckhoff et al \cite{dyckhoff1992contraction}.
\item[intuition \emph{tactic}]
  \footnote{
    \coq Reference Manual, Chapter 8:
    Tactics\\
    \url{https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual010.html\#hevea_tactic156}
  }
  Generates simplified subgoals and applies the provided tactic.
  \text{intuition} succeeds if the provided tactic succeeds on all (simpler) subgoals, else it fails.
  It is based on the decision procedure used in \texttt{tauto}.
  The expression \texttt{intuition fail} is equivalent to \texttt{tauto}.
\item[omega]
  an automatic decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic \cite{stansifer1984presburger}.%
  \footnote{

  }
\end{description}

In this masters thesis we explore the feasibility of implementing a statistical automated theorem prover for \coq.
\todo{statistical vs symbolical ATP; explain the difference}
\todo{explain `hammer' approach and what use it is for premiseselection}

Such an automated theorem prover consists of:
\begin{description}
\item[Premise selection] Filter the existing knowledgebase of proven theorems by usefullness for the current yet unproven conjecture.
It yields a set of theorems which are likely to help in proving this conjecture.
Subsequent ATP components thus will only need to consider useful theorems. \todo{explain}
\item[]
\end{description}

Because this endeavour is quite sizeable, we limit the research to implementing a \premiseselection tool.
We compare various machine learning algorithms and features for a variety of existing \coq corpora.
