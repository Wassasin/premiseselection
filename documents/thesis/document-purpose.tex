% Implement Premise selection for Coq.
% Determine viability of approach on different Coq corpora.

% Only go as far as Premise selection, as this is only a masters' thesis.
% Could dedicate a few PhD positions to this.
For the \coq interactive theorem prover strong automation does not yet exist.
A few limited tactics do exist, for example \texttt{auto} and \texttt{omega}.
In this masters thesis we explore the feasibility of implementing an automated theorem prover for \coq.
Because this endeavour is quite sizeable, we limit the research to implementing a \premiseselection tool.
This tool, for a given corpus of proven theorems, and for a yet unproven conjecture, yields a set of definitions and theorems which are likely to help in proving this conjecture.
We compare various machine learning algorithms and features for a variety of existing \coq corpora.
