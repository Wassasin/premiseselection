Given dependency candidate $\phi \in \depset$, we compute for all features $x \in \featurekeys$:
\[
  W = \tau + \sum_{x \in \featurekeys} w_x ~~\text{with}~~ w_x = \tau + \sum_{\psi \in \parents[\phi]} \left( \features{}{\psi}(x) > 0 \right)
\]

Now we can compute the likelyhood of candidate $\phi$ given some constants $\pi, \sigma, \tau$:
\[
	P_\text{nb}(c, \phi) = \ln W +
  \sum_{x \in \featurekeys | w_x = 0} \features{}{c}(x) \times \sigma +
  \sum_{x \in \featurekeys | w_x \neq 0} \features{}{c}(x) \times \ln(\pi \times w_x) - \ln(W)
\]

By K\"uhlwein \cite{kuhlwein2013mash} it is suggested to use $\pi = 10$, $\sigma = -15$ and $\tau = 20$.
