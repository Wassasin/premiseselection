Started implementing with OCaml
	Best choice for implementing due to easy integration with CoqIDE in later stage.
	Problems arose during implementation:
		- Serialization and deserialization takes an unacceptable amount of time. (3 minutes vs 1 second in C++)
		- Not ideal standard library implementation for List etc. (not tail recursive), resulting in stack overflows for large objects.
		- 3rd party libraries using the standard library thus becoming unsuitable without patches
Chose to re-implement everything except Parser + Interpreter in C++.
	Quite a bit faster for everything.
	Currently KNN CV takes 4.5 minutes

Unclear how to implement AUC-curve
	The AUC (Area under the ROC Curve) is the probability that, given a randomly drawn
	used premise and a randomly drawn unused premise, the used premise is ranked higher than
	the unused premise. Values closer to 1 show better performance.
